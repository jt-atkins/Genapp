# A sample z/OS DBB workflow using GitHub Actions (GHA) with SSH connection
# Global vars
env:
  # SSH connection information
  DBB_Host: '"C:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe" DMJTA1@WTSC47.CPOLAB.IBM.COM -pw ${{ secrets.WTSC47_PW }}' # A valid SSH account on Z. With pre-generated and tested keys in the runner.
  # Pipeline scripts on z/OS (relative to the SSH user's Home Dir in USS)
  Clone: '/u/DMJTA1/GitHubWS/scripts/git-clone-ssh.sh' # Script to clone the code from GitHub to z/OS
  DBB_Build: '/u/DMJTA1/GitHubWS/scripts/dbb-build.sh' # Script to perform the DBB build on z/OS
  UCD_Package: '/u/DMJTA1/GitHubWS/scripts/PublishUCD.sh' # Script to perform the DBB build on z/OS
  UCD_Deploy: '/u/DMJTA1/GitHubWS/scripts/DeployUCD.sh' # Script to perform the DBB build on z/OS
